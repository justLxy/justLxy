# Hello there 👋

## 🌿 About Me

I’m a purpose-driven developer who believes in the quiet power of thoughtful code and meaningful impact. With a background in full-stack development and a deep appreciation for design, I strive to build tools that not only work — but resonate.

Behind every line of code is an intention: to simplify, to connect, to empower. I care deeply about creating experiences that feel intuitive, human, and lasting.

## 🛠️ What I Do

- **Craft Thoughtful Interfaces** with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Architect Backends** with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL  
- **Empower Frontends** with APIs, context-aware logic, and clean design  
- **Explore Ideas** through passion projects and open source contributions  
- **Continuously Learn** with curiosity and empathy as my compass  

## 📬 Let’s Connect

I’m always open to meaningful conversations — about tech, creativity, or life in general. If you resonate with thoughtful, intentional creation, I’d love to hear from you.
